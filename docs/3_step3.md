### Step 3 - Simulating Welfare Over the Distribution of Weather in Alternate Climate or Policy Scenarios

This step involves simulating different climate or policy scenarios by varying either the distribution of weather or the relationship between weather and welfare, respectively. In the first case, the distribution of weather in step 2 is modified to correspond with a future climate scenario - see [Baqui√© and Foucault (2023)](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40533) for more information. In the second case, either (i) the damage function derived in step 1 is modified, or (ii) the household characteristics are modified (especially those interacted with the weather variable) to simulate a specific policy scenario, such as adaptive social protection. The alternate damage function or underlying population are used in step 2 to simulate welfare in different states of the weather. Potential outputs from this step are visualized below.
