# WISE-APP Weather Impact Simulation and Evaluation for Adaptation Policy & Planning

WISE-APP makes it easy to estimate potential welfare outcomes in different weather conditions before events occur. 

It uses harmonized and geocoded household surveys in the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) – the same surveys used to monitor global poverty – and matched weather data to automate the following steps:
1.	Quantify the relationship between weather and welfare
2.	Simulate welfare under historical weather conditions
3.	Simulate welfare under alternate climate and policy scenarios
