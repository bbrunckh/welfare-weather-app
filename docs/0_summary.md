# Summary

The welfare impacts of weather tool makes it easy to estimate potential welfare outcomes in different weather conditions before events occur. It uses harmonized and geocoded household surveys in the Global Monitoring Database (GMD) – the same surveys used to monitor global poverty – and matched weather data to automate the following steps:

1. Quantify the relationship between weather and welfare
2. Simulate welfare under historical weather conditions
3. Simulate welfare under alternate climate and policy scenarios

The tool follows recent guidance from [Baquié and Foucault (2023)](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/40533).
